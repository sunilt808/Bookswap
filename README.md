## 📘 About BookSwap

BookSwap is a platform that provides a simple and convenient way for students to exchange books with each other.  
Instead of buying new books every semester, users can share the books they already have and get new ones in return.

This approach:

- Saves money  
- Promotes reading  
- Reduces book waste  
- Encourages eco-friendly learning  

Students can browse available books, connect with other users, and request exchanges easily.  
The system is designed to be **user-friendly**, ensuring first-time users can navigate without difficulty.

By bringing students together, BookSwap builds collaboration, encourages knowledge sharing, and supports a greener educational environment.
